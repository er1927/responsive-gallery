        <h4>What was your first camera?</h4> 
        <p>I got my first analog camera all myself when I was 11 and was taking a trip to the mountain range with my class as a way to wrap up elementary school. It came as a gift with a kids' magazine called Billiken. My parents got me a 12-exp roll and I used it all up it on the first two days.</p>
        <h4>What is your latest camera?</h4>
        <p>A Canon T3-i, that replaced a Canon T3 that was stolen in 2019.</p>
        <h4>Why aren't you working as a photographer?</h4>
        <p>Because even after all my hard work as an exclusively human-only photographer aboard a cruiseship, snapping 800+ high selling pictures every day for 6 months, Nat Geo is still playing hard ball with me.</p>
        <h4>Tell us a photography secret.</h4>
        <p>I think a lot of photographers with visual impairments, like myself, are just trying to get a proper look at things.</p>
