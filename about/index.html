            <p>There was a camera in the house I grew up in, but getting my hands on it was the rarest of 
                occurrences-if I was deemed less important than the subjects to be photographed, and if 
                they all needed to be in the photo at once, then I could wrap my stubby little fingers 
                around the heavy, black plastic that surrounded whatever magic eye lay inside. <br>
                Photographs were an extra-ordinary thing, not as rare that they still photographed deceased people just to have a 
                souvenir, but expensive enough that you only took pictures of trips & family reunions.<br>
                It, of course, all changed with digital photography: a lightweight, silver sliver of plastic, that I could snap away with almost indefenitely, sans the trip to photo 
                shop. I discovered the selfie as a teenager, the power of recording drunken party mementos as 
                a young adult, and the rest of the entire, vast, beautiful world after that. <br>
                Nowadays I pursue my love affair with birds and fungi through my ever trusty Canon magic eye. </p>
